// |terminate| is the entry point for orderly "quit" operations in Cocoa. This
// includes the application menu's Quit menu item and keyboard equivalent, the
// application's dock icon menu's Quit menu item, "quit" (not "force quit") in
// the Activity Monitor, and quits triggered by user logout and system restart
// and shutdown.
//
// We override the normal |terminate| implementation. Our implementation, which
// is specific to the asynchronous nature of Flutter, works by asking the
// application delegate to terminate using its |requestApplicationTermination|
// method instead of going through |applicationShouldTerminate|.
//
// The standard |applicationShouldTerminate| is not used because returning
// NSTerminateLater from that function moves the run loop into a modal dialog
// mode (NSModalPanelRunLoopMode), which stops the main run loop from processing
// messages like, for instance, the response to the method channel call, and
// code paths leading to it must be redirected to |requestApplicationTermination|.
//
// |requestApplicationTermination| differs from the standard
// |applicationShouldTerminate| in that no special event loop is run in the case
// that immediate termination is not possible (e.g., if dialog boxes allowing
// the user to cancel have to be shown, or data needs to be saved). Instead,
// requestApplicationTermination sends a method channel call to the framework asking
// it if it is OK to terminate. When that method channel call returns with a
// result, the application either terminates or continues running.
